Transform your CLI documentation from static code blocks or heavy GIF/Video into **self-testing, interactive, lightweight demos** that stay current automatically.

## Use `dg` to capture your terminal session

```

## FAQ

### **Q: What about GPL licensing concerns?**
**A:** asciinema is GPL3.0 license. Enterprise escape hatch available: `export DG_GPL_OFF=1` uses system asciinema installation instead of bundled binaries.

### **Q: How does validation work?**  
**A:** DG re-runs your original commands and compares exit codes + filtered output. Interactive demos are automatically skipped in CI.

### **Q: What platforms are supported?**
**A:** macOS (ARM64, x64), Linux (x64 glibc), Windows via WSL2. Platform-specific binaries auto-installed.

### **Q: How big are the generated assets?**
**A:** SVG demos are typically 50-100x smaller than equivalent GIFs.
